# User Stories & Real-World Scenarios

Discover how different users leverage the Cloud Resource Access Control system to solve real-world infrastructure challenges.

## 🎓 University Research Scenario

### Dr. Elena Rodriguez - AI Research Team Lead

**Background**: Dr. Rodriguez leads a machine learning research team at a major university. Her team needs access to specialized GPU clusters for training large neural networks, but resources are shared among multiple departments.

#### The Challenge
- **Resource Contention**: 5 different research teams competing for 3 GPU clusters
- **Complex Scheduling**: Experiments can run for days or weeks
- **Budget Tracking**: Need to track resource usage per grant/project
- **External Collaborators**: Visiting researchers need temporary access

#### The Solution

**🗓️ Smart Scheduling**
Using the calendar interface, Dr. Rodriguez can:
- Book GPU clusters weeks in advance for major experiments
- Set up recurring reservations for weekly model training sessions  
- View real-time availability across all clusters
- Receive notifications when resources become available

**🔗 Automated Setup**
When she books a cluster, the webhook system automatically:
1. Provisions the cluster with her team's Docker images
2. Mounts shared datasets from the university's storage system
3. Configures network access for the team's development machines
4. Sets up monitoring dashboards for the experiment

**📊 Real-time Monitoring**
From the webhook logs shown in your dashboard, Dr. Rodriguez can see:
- ✅ **Success**: "polito-switch-port-webhook1" - Network configuration completed (200)
- ✅ **Success**: "polito-restart-metal3-webhook" - Cluster provisioning completed (200)  
- ❌ **Failed**: Quick identification when integrations fail (500 status)

## 🏢 Enterprise Cloud Operations

### Mark Chen - Cloud Infrastructure Engineer

**Background**: Mark manages cloud infrastructure for a fintech company. He needs to coordinate between development teams, staging environments, and production deployments across AWS, Azure, and on-premises data centers.

#### The Challenge
- **Multi-cloud Complexity**: Resources spread across 3 cloud providers
- **Compliance Requirements**: SOX compliance requires detailed audit trails
- **Team Coordination**: 15 development teams with different access levels
- **Cost Control**: Need to prevent resource sprawl and optimize usage

#### The Solution

**🏗️ Multi-site Management**
Using the site dropdown in the webhook configuration:
- **AWS East**: Production workloads and databases
- **Azure West**: Development and testing environments  
- **On-Premises**: Sensitive data processing and legacy systems

![Sites Management](/img/sites.png)

**🔐 Role-Based Access Control**
- **Developers**: Can book dev/test resources, view their own reservations
- **Team Leads**: Can manage team resources and view usage reports
- **Operations**: Full access to all resources and webhook configurations
- **Auditors**: Read-only access to logs and reports

![User Management Interface](/img/user_management.png)

**🔗 Integration Ecosystem**
Mark has configured webhooks for:
- **Terraform Automation**: Automatically provision infrastructure
- **ITSM Integration**: Create ServiceNow tickets for resource changes
- **Cost Management**: Update billing systems with resource usage
- **Security Tools**: Notify security teams of new resource deployments

## 🔬 Laboratory Equipment Management

### Dr. Sarah Kim - Lab Equipment Coordinator

**Background**: Dr. Kim manages a shared research facility with expensive scientific equipment (electron microscopes, spectrometers, clean rooms) that multiple research groups need to access.

#### The Challenge
- **Equipment Scheduling**: $2M+ equipment needs precise scheduling
- **Preparation Time**: Equipment requires setup/calibration between users
- **Training Requirements**: Only trained users should access certain equipment
- **Maintenance Windows**: Regular maintenance affects availability

#### The Solution

**🛠️ Equipment-Specific Workflows**
Using the "Resources by type" option in webhook configuration:
- **Type: Electron Microscope**: 2-hour setup webhook, user certification check
- **Type: Clean Room**: Access control integration, environmental monitoring
- **Type: Spectrometer**: Sample preparation automation, results archiving

**📋 Advanced Event Handling**
From the webhook interface, Dr. Kim configured:
- **Booking Created**: Check user certifications, send preparation instructions
- **Booking Started**: Unlock equipment access, start monitoring systems
- **Booking Ended**: Lock equipment, initiate cleaning protocols, archive data

**📈 Usage Analytics**
The audit logs help Dr. Kim:
- Track equipment utilization rates
- Identify peak usage periods for capacity planning
- Monitor webhook success rates for equipment integrations
- Generate reports for facility management

## 🚀 DevOps Pipeline Integration

### Alex Thompson - DevOps Team Lead

**Background**: Alex leads DevOps for a SaaS company. The team needs to coordinate CI/CD pipeline resources, manage deployment environments, and ensure development teams have access to testing infrastructure.

#### The Challenge
- **Pipeline Bottlenecks**: Limited build servers cause deployment delays
- **Environment Conflicts**: Multiple teams deploying to same staging environments
- **Cost Optimization**: Cloud resources running 24/7 without usage
- **Compliance**: Need deployment approval workflows

#### The Solution

**⚡ Automated Pipeline Integration**
Webhook configurations for different scenarios:
- **All Events → CI/CD System**: Update pipeline status and resource availability
- **Specific Resource → Build Servers**: Scale build capacity based on reservations
- **Resource Type → Staging Envs**: Coordinate deployment schedules

**💰 Cost Optimization**
Smart resource management:
- **Booking Started**: Webhook powers on cloud instances
- **Booking Ended**: Webhook gracefully shuts down resources
- **Off-hours**: Automated cleanup of unused development environments

**🔍 Pipeline Visibility**
Using the webhook logs dashboard:
- Monitor integration health across the entire CI/CD pipeline
- Quick identification of bottlenecks (failed webhook = stuck deployment)
- Real-time status of all development environments
