# Cloud Resource Reservation System Overview

Welcome to the **Cloud Resource Access Control** - a comprehensive platform designed to automate and manage cloud resource reservations with intelligent webhook integration and real-time monitoring capabilities.

## üéØ What is Cloud Resource Access Control?

The Cloud Resource Access Control system is an enterprise-grade platform that provides:

- **Centralized Resource Management**: Manage all your cloud resources from a single dashboard
- **Intelligent Booking System**: Calendar-based reservation system with conflict resolution
- **Real-time Webhook Integration**: Seamless integration with external systems through configurable webhooks
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Track every action with detailed logs and status monitoring
- **Multi-site Support**: Manage resources across multiple sites and locations
- **Role-based Access Control**: Secure user management with Keycloak integration

## üè¢ Common Use Cases & Problem Solutions

The Cloud Resource Access Control system addresses critical challenges in modern IT infrastructure management:

### Infrastructure Management Challenges
- **Resource Conflicts**: Eliminate scheduling conflicts when multiple teams need the same specialized computing resources
- **Manual Coordination**: Replace inefficient spreadsheet and email-based resource scheduling with automated systems
- **Integration Complexity**: Simplify complex integrations between different tools and APIs used by various teams
- **Audit Requirements**: Meet compliance needs with comprehensive logging and tracking capabilities
- **Multi-site Management**: Centrally manage resources distributed across different physical locations or cloud providers

### Complete Workflow Solutions

**üóìÔ∏è Centralized Booking & Scheduling**
The platform provides:
- Unified calendar interface for viewing all available resources
- Automatic conflict detection and resolution
- Support for recurring reservations for ongoing projects
- Automated notifications for upcoming reservations and status changes

**üîó Automated Resource Provisioning**
When a resource is booked, the system can automatically:
1. Trigger webhooks to configure the target infrastructure
2. Provision SSH access with appropriate authentication keys
3. Update network policies to enable team access
4. Notify monitoring systems to track resource utilization

**üîê Enterprise-Grade Security**
Security features include:
- Role-based access control ensuring users only see authorized resources
- Granular permissions management for different user groups
- Webhook signature validation for authenticated external communications

### Infrastructure Components

- **üñ•Ô∏è reservation-fe**: React-based frontend application providing an intuitive user interface
- **üîå reservation-be**: Backend service handling business logic, APIs, and database operations
- **‚ö° reservation-event-processor**: Event-driven microservice for asynchronous processing
- **üîë Keycloak**: Authentication and authorization service
- **üóÑÔ∏è PostgreSQL**: Database for persistent data storage

## How Components Interact

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the React frontend to create reservations and configure resources
2. **API Layer**: The backend provides RESTful APIs secured with Keycloak authentication
3. **Event Processing**: Asynchronous events are processed by the event processor microservice
4. **Webhook Integration**: Custom webhooks enable integration with external resource providers
5. **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in PostgreSQL with proper transaction management

### Deployments

- **üê≥ Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization and local development environment - see on [github](https://github.com/giovannimirarchi420/cloud-resource-reservation)
- **‚ò∏Ô∏è prognose-helm-chart**: Kubernetes deployment using Helm charts - see our [Kubernetes Deployment Guide](./guides/kubernetes-deployment.md)
- **üîó Webhook System**: Extensible webhook framework for resource integration - see our [Webhooks Guide](./guides/webhooks.md)
